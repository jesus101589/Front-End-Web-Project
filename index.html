        <h2>Pecan Tree - The Official State Tree of Texas</h2>
        <img src="images/pecan150.jpg" alt="Photo of a Pecan tree, the offical tree of Texas">
            <p class="asideparagraph">
                Rumor has it that James Stephen Hogg made a special request to have a pecan tree over his grave. 
                As a result, the native tree rose in popularity. It was declared the state tree in 1919.
                Widespread in the wild and popular as a yard tree, the pecan is native to Texas and produces the state's only commercially grown nut.
